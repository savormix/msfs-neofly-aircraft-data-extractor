A console application to display aircraft data required to add/update an aircraft in NeoFly in real time (as different aircraft/liveries are selected in MSFS).

## Usage

- Run msfs-neofly-aircraft-data-extractor.exe
- Console window opens (leave it open; aircraft data will be displayed here):

  `MSFS Aircraft Data Extractor for NeoFly v1.1.2`
- Confirm successful connection with MSFS (or start MSFS and wait for it):

  `--- Connected to MSFS`
- When MSFS finishes initial loading (if not already), aircraft data will be displayed, for example:
  ```markdown
  Current aircraft:
  - Name: 103 Solo Aviators Club Livery
  - Type: Prop
  - Engine(s): 1 (Piston)
  - Category: A
  - Cruise speed (kt): 47
  - Range (NM): Unknown
  - Empty weight (lbs): 254
  - Max fuel (lbs): 30
  - Max payload (lbs): 296
  - Max takeoff weight (lbs): 550
  - Pax: 0
  ```
- Select a different aircraft/livery and go back to the main menu:
  ```markdown
  Current aircraft:
  - Name: Savage Shock Ultra Asobo Skis

  - Max fuel (lbs): 168
  - Max payload (lbs): 670
  - Max takeoff weight (lbs): 1320
  - Pax: 0
  ```
- Repeat as necessary:
  ```markdown

- When finished, close the console window

## FAQ

- **Q: Why is aircraft range "Unknown"?**

  A: _Reference values_ (values named `ui_â€¦` in `aircraft.cfg`) are not used during simulation and are not available via SimConnect.
  This application will extract the range value from file for non-marketplace aircraft, but there is **no EULA compliant way to do this for marketplace-locked aircraft**.

  If you receive an `Unknown` value for non-marketplace aircraft, [raise an issue](https://github.com/savormix/msfs-neofly-aircraft-data-extractor/issues).

- **Q: Why does the cruise speed not match what is shown at aircraft selection screen?**

  A: This application provides the _Aircraft Design Vc_ value. Some aircraft are known to specify their afterburner speed in the selection menu instead.

- **Q: Why are airliners shown with -1 passengers?**
  
  A: Not enough data available (to SimConnect or in general) to report an accurate number.
- **Q: The type/category/pax number/max range for aircraft X is completely wrong!**

  A: [Raise an issue](https://github.com/savormix/msfs-neofly-aircraft-data-extractor/issues)
